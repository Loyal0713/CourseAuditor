# CourseAuditor

This project is a term project for a college class. The course auditor's purpose is to provide students easy access to the Computer Science courses they have taken, will take, and need to take. It will also provide information regarding expected graduation time. It also allows administrators in the Computer Science department to view the courses they teach and view their students relevant course work.

The MySqlConnection class serves as communication between the program and the database.

The Student class is a representation of individual students. Each student has a first and last name, a unique id, and a list of all courses needed to complete a Computer Science degree (in regards to Central Michigan's criteria).

The Main class serves only as a debugging class and all test code gets tested here.

The Course class represents a course. It holds a a String name representing what the courses name is and an integer representing what semester it was taken (0 if it has not been taken yet).
